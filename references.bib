Abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are population-based global optimizers, which, due to their characteristics, have allowed us to solve, in a straightforward way, many real world optimization problems in the last three decades, particularly in engineering fields. Their main advantages are the following: they do not require any requisite to the objective/fitness evaluation function (continuity, derivability, convexity, etc.); they are not limited by the appearance of discrete and/or mixed variables or by the requirement of uncertainty quantification in the search. Moreover, they can deal with more than one objective function simultaneously through the use of evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms. This set of advantages, and the continuously increased computing capability of modern computers, has enhanced their application in research and industry. From the application point of view, in this Special Issue, all engineering fields are welcomed, such as aerospace and aeronautica},

Abstract = {The vast majority of real-world problems can be expressed as an optimisation task by formulating an objective function, also known as cost or fitness function. The most logical methods to optimise such a function when (1) an analytical expression is not available, (2) mathematical hypotheses do not hold, and (3) the dimensionality of the problem or stringent real-time requirements make it infeasible to find an exact solution mathematically are from the field of Evolutionary Computation (EC) and Swarm Intelligence (SI). The latter are broad and still growing subjects in Computer Science in the study of metaheuristic approaches, i.e., those approaches which do not make any assumptions about the problem function, inspired from natural phenomena such as, in the first place, the evolution process and the collaborative behaviours of groups of animals and communities, respectively. This book contains recent advances in the EC and SI fields, covering most themes currently receiving a great de},

abstract = {Diversity estimation of Pareto front (PF) approximations is a critical issue in the field of evolutionary multiobjective optimization. However, the existing diversity indicators are usually inappropriate for PF approximations with more than three objectives. Many of them can be utilized only when compared with approximations obtained by multiple multiobjective optimizers, which makes them difficult to use online. In this paper, we propose a unary diversity indicator based on reference vectors (DIR) to estimate the diversity of PF approximations for many-objective optimization. In DIR, a set of uniform and widespread reference vectors are generated. The coverage of each solution in the objective space is evaluated by the number of representative reference vectors it is associated with. The diversity (both spread and uniformity) is determined by the standard deviation of the coverage for all the solutions. The smaller value of DIR, the better the diversity of a PF approximation is. DIR can be applied to a unary approximation without any compared approximations needed. Thus, DIR is easy to use as either an offline indicator to estimate the performance of an optimizer or an online indicator for the selection of solutions in a MOEA. In the experimental studies, both the artificial and the real PF approximations generated by seven different many-objective algorithms are used to verify DIR as an offline indicator. The effects of the number of reference vectors on DIR are also investigated. In addition, as an online indicator, DIR is integrated into a Pareto-dominance-based evolutionary multiobjective optimizer, NSGA-II. The experimental studies show it has the significant performance enhancements over the original NSGA-II on many-objective optimization problems.}
